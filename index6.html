			<p> Hello, my name is Jeriksen Timbang. This is the homepage to my website. I am currently a student at SJSU. I love to create, inspire, laugh, make others laugh, dance, and food. Considering I am a Graphic Design major, ART 74 has been a good class to take, because I learned how to design on different platforms! If you have read this far, I hope you're having a good day. </p>
