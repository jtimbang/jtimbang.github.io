			<p>		
			Hello, my name is Jeriksen Timbang and this is my artist statement. As a creator my creations are always inspired by intentions or by my subjective view of beauty. Every individual on this planet is one of a kind and has their own view of reality. Art is very precious because it is a platform for us to express our unique realities.
			<br>	
			<br>As an artist I am driven by different intentions. Rather than produce a narrative, I like to create art in order to express my idea of what I think is beautiful or to provoke emotions. The emotions I tend to try to provoke in my viewers is awe, wander, and sometimes apathy.  Usually these emotions are simply what I am feeling at the time. 
			<br>
			<br>My favorite mediums for expressing my idea of beauty or to provoke emotion is photography, drawing (usually pencil and paper), music, and dance. As I continue to grow, I hope to expand the amount of mediums I use, as well as  my ability and skills within the mediums I already use.
			<br>
			<br> 
			<br> 

			Thank you,
			<br> 
			Jeriksen Timbang
